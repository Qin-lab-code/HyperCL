## Introduction
In this work, we propose HyperCL, a novel hyperbolic graph contrastive learning framework for recommendation.
Unlike existing methods that rely on tangent space approximations of hyperbolic space, HyperCL fully leverages both tangent and hyperbolic spaces by encoding augmented views from both and constructing contrast pairs based on learned node representations.
This design not only exploits the geometric advantages of both spaces but also enables seamless information transmission between them.

## Enviroment Requirement
## Dataset
We provide three processed datasets: Amazon-CD, Yelp and Amazon-book
